Soil, also commonly referred to as earth or dirt, is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that together support life. Some scientific definitions distinguish dirt from soil by restricting the former term specifically to displaced soil.

Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter `(the soil matrix)`, as well as a porous phase that holds gases `(the soil atmosphere)` and water `(the soil solution)`.`[1][2]` Accordingly, soil is a three-state system of solids, liquids, and gases.`[3]` Soil is a product of several factors: the influence of climate, relief `(elevation, orientation, and slope of terrain)`, organisms, and the soil's parent materials `(original minerals)` interacting over time.`[4]` It continually undergoes development by way of numerous physical, chemical and biological processes, which include weathering with associated erosion.`[5]` Given its complexity and strong internal connectedness, soil ecologists regard soil as an ecosystem.`[6]`

- Soil microorganisms encompass archaea, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. They are responsible for the majority of enzymatic processes in soil and store energy and nutrients in their biomass `(Jenkinson and Ladd, 1981)`.
